In this question, I am going to use four point correspondences method to rectify the image.

After I figured out the correct coordinate system direction, I started to try using the basic Direct Linear Transformation algorithm (page 91) to calculate homography matrix H.
Calculate the matrix Ai for each pair of points. Ai is a 2x9 matrix. 
	Ai =     0T           -wi 'xiT       yi 'xi T
	        wi 'xiT          0T         -xi 'xi T
     
Assemble the four different Ai into a single 8x9 matrix A. 
We have A h =0.
Calculate the SVD of 8x9 matrix A. A=UDV', then h is the last column of V.
Normalize matrix h so that the last element is 1. 
Reshape h into a 3x3 matrix H, which is our output homography matrix.
